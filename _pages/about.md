Hi, I am Yuchen Zhu, a 2nd year Machine Learning PhD at Georgia Tech.

My interests lie in the broad aspects of **GenAI**, wich applications in vision, language, and sciences (e.g. single cell genomics, protein sciences, quantum physics, etc). My research currently focuses on **diffusion generative models** (especially for non-Euclidean data) and **multimodal foundation models** (such as VLMs). 

At Georgia Tech, I am fortunate to be advised by [Molei Tao](https://mtao8.math.gatech.edu/) and working with a group of incredible researchers. Prior to that, I graduated with MA in Statistics from [Yale University](https://statistics.yale.edu/) and BS in Honors Mathematics with highest honor from [NYU Shanghai](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/). During those time, I had the privilege to work with [Zhuoran Yang](https://zhuoranyang.github.io/) and [Mathieu Lauri√®re](https://mlauriere.github.io/) on reinforcement learning and mean field games.
