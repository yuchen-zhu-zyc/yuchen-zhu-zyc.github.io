Hi, I am Yuchen Zhu, a first year Machine Learning PhD at Georgia Tech.

I work on **diffusion models, mean field games, sampling and optimal transport.** I am primarily interested in the intersection of dynamics, deep learning and statistics, with application in generative modeling, game theory, scientific machine learning and reinforcement learning. 

At Georgia Tech, I am fortunate to be advised by [Molei Tao](https://mtao8.math.gatech.edu/) and working with a group of incredible researchers. Prior to that, I graduated with MA in Statistics from [Yale University](https://statistics.yale.edu/) and BS in Honors Mathematics with highest honor from [NYU Shanghai](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/). During these times, I had the privilege to work with [Zhuoran Yang](https://zhuoranyang.github.io/) and [Mathieu Lauri√®re](https://mlauriere.github.io/) on reinforcement learning and mean field games.
